			<h3>Grandpa Gamer</h3>
		
			<p>This climate of the Overwatch community has changed a lot in the last four years. I was 
			around when everyone was terrible at the game. Nowadays, the difference in skill between each 
			rank is tremendous. Some streamers have made games out of guessing people's skill rating 
			because it's possible to tell how good someone is based on something as simple as how they move.
			When I started playing, there was noone around to help me. Everyone was busy trying to learn, 
			themselves. Fortunately, people have gotten much better and have decided to spread their 
			gaming wisdom in the form of Overwatch Guides.</p>

			<h2>Hero Guides</h2>
			
			<p>There are way too many hero guides on the internet right now and yet, I'm still not GM.
			Overwatch is way more complicated than the top500 streamer you watch makes it out to be.
			It isn't enough to just watch a guide anymore. You need to understand all of the core mechanics,
			hero matchups, positioning and rotations, and way too much more. It is important to start off with 
			simple things, and then work your way up to more advanced topics. Also, the thing that will allow 
			you to climb much faster than any other tip someone can give you, lean in because it might surprise 
			you, is <strong>playing the game</strong>. I've done my fair share of coaching, but the advice
			you give people doesn't matter when they just forget it by the next vod review. If you're going
			to watch a guide, you need to be actively playing the game or you're just going to forget it.
			If you don't play competitive, then, you won't get SR. Lecture over.</p>
