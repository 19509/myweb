			<p>Meta is not something that very easily grasped by people that haven't played hero-based shooters.
				It is constantly changing with every patch, takes massive amounts of game knowledge and coordination 
				to pull off efficiently, and is generally frustrating when, even though you played perfectly, your 
				team gets steamrolled into oblivion. For the most part, ranks below diamond don't have to deal with 
				meta as the team coordination isn't there to pull it off. That doesn't mean that newer players 
				shouldn't have, at least, a basic understanding of it, though.</p>
				
			<p>There is no way that I will be able to list every meta in Overwatch's history here. There have just
			been way too many in Overwatch's four long years for me to remember them all. But, I can go through the
			most impactful metas, noting why they were strong and how to play them. It is important to know the past 
			as metas have a tendency to eventually come back into the game if the patches line up correctly.</p>

			<h3>The Meta</h3>
			
				<p>
					<Strong>With great diversity comes great headaches</strong>. Or something like that. Any Overwatch player
				will tell you that the game has had a rough relationship with patches. There have been points in the game where
				metas persist beyond 6 months, consecutively. The meta, if you don't know, is a term used to describe the
				optimal team composition and playstyle depending on the patch. Let's take the <em>Goats</em> composition for 
				example. <em>Goats</em> was an open division team that blew through their season in 2018. Boasting a team
				composition consisting of Reinhardt, Zarya, D.Va, Brigitte, Lucio, and Zen, they dominated every game and 
				qualified for contenders. The rest of the community saw what was happening and quickly took on the playstyle.
				This of course included the Overwatch League (The highest tier of play in Overwatch esports). And that was the
				catalyst. All any Overwatch player saw for the next 8 months was Goats. 
			
				<p>
					There are some players that will tell you that they enjoyed the Goats meta. I like to believe that they forgot
				how boring it was to play, or that they just miss the good old days. The fact of the matter is, once Goats entered
				the equation, Overwatch League viewer numbers went down, and active playerbase numbers went down. The Overwatch team
				had to do something. They couldn't just let their IP slowly die. Enter <em>role queue</em>. The most important 
				change made to the game in it's 4 years of life. The gamemode allows you to queue for a single role instead
				of hoping that your team doesn't flame you into filling for the ninth game in a row. After role queue everything
				changed. Toxicity in the game went down, player numbers spiked back up, and it just made the game better. Of
				course, Blizzard still needed to deal with all the buffs that came out to attempt to counteract Goats since the
				meta was no longer viable in a Role Queue setting, but, for the most part, the community was happy. Skip to now,
				we get patch changes every other week which allows everyone to play their main for a little while, a stark contrast
				to Blizzard's old patch mentality of a change taking a month and a half to take effect. I think I agree with a lot
				of the player base that Overwatch is in the best state it has been in in at least 3 years.</p>
			
				<p class="par">Well, I could build a house with all the walls of text I've given you up to this point. Let's get to 
				some real Overwatch resources.</p>
