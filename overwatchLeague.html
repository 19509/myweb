			<h3>UnderStanding Competition</h3>
		
			<p>In my opinion, the Overwatch pro scene is misunderstood by pretty much everyone in the 
			Overwatch community. It's not their fault, though. Blizzard barely tries to corroborate
			an understanding of its own esport. There's too many brackets and tiers for someone to just
			look at and be able to understand. I also think that it is important for players to understand
			the importance of the pro league in realtion to most of the community. For those that take the
			game seriously, it works as a common goal between players. In many peoples' eyes, the competitve
			ladder is a bit of a joke, so, people look up to the Overwatch League and other structured 
			competition.

			<p>The Overwatch pro league has been cut into three distinct <em>official</em>
			sections. These are referred to as "tiers". Tier 1 would include The Overwatch League 
			and the World Cup. Tier 2 would be Contenders and Contenders Trials. Tier 3 is Open
			Division. Anything below these three tiers is considered Tier 4. This would include
			open tournaments and promotional tournaments.</p>
			
			<h2>Overwatch League and World Cup</h2>
			
			<p>The Overwatch League is definitely the most known tournament when it comes to Overwatch.
			Many community legends made their mark there and works as a goal for players attempting to 
			go pro. The World Cup is also quite popular but lacks the competitive engagement that the 
			League has despite beaing a tournament that is marketed as the highest tier of play. Many
			of the World Cup's shortcomings are due to a lack of organization and short notice to teams.</p>
		
			<h2>Contenders/Trials</h2>
			
			<p>I'll try to explain Contenders as best as I can, but I barely understand it, myself. The
			way I see it, Contenders works on a "promotion and relegation" system with teams dropping 
			and gaining tiers based on their performance in the tournament. So if you do poorly in a week
			of Contenders, ending up in on of the bottom 4 or bottom 8 teams, depending on the week, you'll
			move down to a lower tier of play. In this example, that lower tier of play would be Contenders 
			Trials. Below Contenders Trials is Open Division. Similarly, you move up through the tiers by
			winning games and ending up in the top 4 or 8 teams, also depending on the week. From what I 
			can tell, teams only gain points by winning games while in Contenders, not in Trials or OD.</p>
			
			<h2>Open Division</h2>
			
			<p>This is the entry point in Blizzard's "path to pro". On the <em>Overwatch League</em> website,
			it say something along the lines of, "grind through quick play and competitive and begin your path
			as a pro in the Open Division tournament and face off against the best in the world." It's something 
			along those lines. Much harder than it sounds. Open Division is not for new players. Although, the 
			rank requirement has been removed, most of the teams that play in Open Division are high masters at 
			least. Most teams below that get knocked out first day. I recommend playing in lower tier, player 
			controlled, tournaments. It'll allow you to get a feel for team play without crushing your dreams
			into the floor. There are some decent ones like Altitude's Mock Overwatch League and Transendence
			as well as many others. Going pro is something that takes a lot of time and doesn't pay well at all.
			Inform yourself more about the subject before deciding you're going to be the next Sinatraa.</p>
