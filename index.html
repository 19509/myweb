			<h2>Why?</h2>
			
			
			<p>The primary purpose of this website is to help newer players get a better understanding of how 
			Overwatch, and its community, functions. I've tried to get some of my friends to play this game in
			the past, but most of the time, they leave before it the game gets good. The most common reasons were
			"the game is too fast", "I don't know what to play", and "I don't know what's going on".</p>
			
			
			<p>I can't really blame them for their lack of understanding. This is not a new-player friendly game.
			I've been playing Overwatch for 4 years and I don't even understand many of the intricacies that draw
			me to the game. This website is an information archive for those looking for a better understanding of 
			the game.</p>

			<h3>A Brief History</h3>
			
			<p>	
				Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer shooter that was first announced at <em>BlizzCon 2014</em>.
			It came about as the remnants of a scrapped Blizzard project known as <strong><em>Titan</em></strong>.
			The game went through it's beta cycle and was fully released May of 2016. The games initial launch
			consisted of 21 characters, separated into 4 classes. Since then, Overwatch has become a staple of
			the hero-shooter genre and the goto esport in it's category.</p>
		
			
			<p>	Since the games release in 2016, Overwatch has changed immensely. Blizzard has revamped the visuals,
			altered core mechanics and added a plethora of new characters (up to 32 now) and maps, 
			adding diversity to the cast and gameplay. Blizzard has continued to update the IP, stating that there will 
			be a sequal coming out at some point in time in the near future. Rumors from reliable leakers such as the 
			streamer <em>Metro</em> suggest that Overwatch 2 will be released in the first quarter of next year, but 
			the reality is that only Blizzard has knowledge of the project timeline and there is any way of knowing 
			exactly when the game will be released until they put out an official statement.</p>
		
			<p>
				Although Blizzard has a tendency to leave their players players in the dark, the community has rejoiced
			in the Overwatch team's revitalization of the game through consistent patches. The team had a dark run last 
			year with very little updates wich made metas last up 7 months which made the game stale and infuriated the 
			core playerbase. 2019 Showed a downward trend in active player numbers, but, now that more attention is being
			paid to the game, many people in the community believe that game is in one of the best spots that it has ever
			been. Hopefully, the Overwatch team will continue to bolster the game with new updates up to the release of 
			Overwatch 2 in 2021.</p>
